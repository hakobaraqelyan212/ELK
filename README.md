Run the latest version of the Elastic stack with Docker and Docker Compose.

It gives you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch and the visualization power of Kibana.

Based on the official Docker images from Elastic:

Elasticsearch
Logstash
Kibana


Tasks:
    1. Create automation with github actions which will deploy the infra with docker-compose container
    2. Create Docker compose file which will deploy Elasticsearch + logstash + kibana and configure all 3
    3. Collect logs from syslog and auth.log
